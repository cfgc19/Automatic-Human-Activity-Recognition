# Automatic-Human-Activity-Recognition
In this project were developed several classifiers for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using data collected from 30 subjects performing activities of daily living while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

Consider two scenarios:

• Scenario A (Binary Problem): where one where one want to discriminate if a given person is walking or not;

• Scenario B (Multiclass Problem): where differentiation among six different activities are required (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and laying).
